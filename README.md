# TypeScript Backend Starter with PostgreSQL, Express, and Node.js

A flexible backend starter built with **TypeScript**, **PostgreSQL**, **Express**, and **Node.js**. This boilerplate is designed to be backend-agnostic, allowing you to easily connect it with any frontend framework, such as **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**, or any custom solution.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for better development experience.
- **Express**: Fast, minimal web framework for Node.js.
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful, open-source relational database.
- **Backend-Agnostic**: Ready to connect with any frontend framework.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple steps to get up and running.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **PostgreSQL** (v12 or later)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeerUzairWasHere/TypePEN.git
cd TypePEN
```

---

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd backend && npm install
```

- **Make sure you have TypeScript installed globally**. If not, you can install it globally with:

  ```bash
  npm install -g typescript
  ```

  Or, you can install TypeScript as a project dependency:

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev typescript
  ```

### Set Up Environment Variables

1. **Get a remote PostgreSQL database**. You can use services like [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/), [NeonDB](https://neon.tech/), or any other PostgreSQL provider to create a database instance.

2. **Rename the `.env.example` file** to `.env` and paste the PostgreSQL connection string into the `DATABASE_URL` variable:

   Example:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-connection-string
   ```

   Make sure to replace `your-postgresql-connection-string` with the actual URL you get from your PostgreSQL provider.

### Running Database Migrations

For the **first-time database migration**, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev:migrate --init
```

This will create the necessary tables and apply the initial migrations to your database.

For **subsequent migrations**, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev:migrate your-migration-name
```

Replace `your-migration-name` with the appropriate name for the migration you want to apply.

### Running the Backend

To **start the backend normally**, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After running the backend, you will see a log message like this in the terminal:

```
Server is listening on http://localhost:3000/
```

The server will be running on whatever port is specified in your `.env` file (default is port 3000). You can now connect your backend to any frontend framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) and start building your application!

#### **First-time Run**

- On the **first-time** run of the application, it will redirect you to a documentation page. This is typically used for API documentation generated by Swagger UI.
  
**Note**: If you do not want the Swagger UI documentation page to appear, **comment out or remove** the related Swagger UI code in your `app.ts` or wherever it is configured. This can be found in the section where you have set up API documentation.

## Connecting with Frontend Frameworks

This backend is designed to be easily connected with **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**, or any other frontend framework. You can create RESTful API endpoints and consume them on the frontend.

## Testing (Coming Soon, Stay Tuned!)

You can add tests to the `tests` folder and run them using your preferred testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha).

To run tests (once theyâ€™re set up):

```bash
npm run test
```
